## 🔒 Security Note

- `.env.local` is already in `.gitignore` - your keys won't be committed
- Never share your API keys
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Keys starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are included in client bundle (necessary for client-side API calls)

## 💡 Recommendation

**Start with Gemini Pro** because:
- ✅ Free tier with generous limits
- ✅ Fast response times
- ✅ Great quality insights

2. **Check file name**: Must be exactly `.env.local` (with the dot)
3. **Check syntax**: No quotes around the key, no spaces
4. **Restart server**: Must restart after adding keys
5. **Check key**: Copy/paste carefully, including the full key

If still stuck, the error message now provides step-by-step help!
